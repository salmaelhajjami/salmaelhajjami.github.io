title: "Using Semantic Web Technologies and Multi- agent System for Multi-dimensional Analysis of Open Health Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-Journal01
excerpt: "Abstract : Recent years have seen Social Web becoming a global phenomenon, which is being in- creasingly important in our daily lives. Millions of users are chatting on the Web and social networks and expressing their feelings and opinions about the latest outbreaks, symptoms, illnesses and new drugs. These opinions contain a large amount of data, which are destined to become a major source of infor- mation for business intelligence, as they are largely informative and therefore interesting to be dealt with in a decision-making process, in order to evaluate and improve the performance of health system. However, this source of information is currently underutilised. This work describes an approach to creating an analytical health framework that allows the integration and multi-dimensional analysis of available health data, with particular attention to socially generated data, using Semantic Web (SW) technologies and multi-agent systems."

Abstract : Recent years have seen Social Web becoming a global phenomenon, which is being in- creasingly important in our daily lives. Millions of users are chatting on the Web and social networks and expressing their feelings and opinions about the latest outbreaks, symptoms, illnesses and new drugs. These opinions contain a large amount of data, which are destined to become a major source of infor- mation for business intelligence, as they are largely informative and therefore interesting to be dealt with in a decision-making process, in order to evaluate and improve the performance of health system. However, this source of information is currently underutilised. This work describes an approach to creating an analytical health framework that allows the integration and multi-dimensional analysis of available health data, with particular attention to socially generated data, using Semantic Web (SW) technologies and multi-agent systems.
