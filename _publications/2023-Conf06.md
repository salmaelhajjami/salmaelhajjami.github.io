title: "Using the Ethereum Blockchain to Secure a Crowdfunding System in the Real Estate Sector"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-Conf06
excerpt: "Abstract : The covid-19 crisis has severely affected the dynamics of the real estate sector, which is facing various financial and structural problems. The current real estate world is complicated by the lack of transparency in transactions such as rental, purchase, and sale, and it does not reach the level of confidentiality and authenticity of operational data. In addition, real estate financing brings together several players such as banks, notaries, and others, which makes the acquisition of real estate very expensive. With the advent of blockchain technology, many fields such as finance, accounting, and real estate have received a positive impact using the benefits of this technology. This article aims to reorganize real estate into a next-generation digitized system based on blockchain technology, by proposing a crowdfunding model that aims to eliminate intermediate, costs. Moreover, this model can allow to customers, who do not have immediate financing, the possibility of acquiring real estate. We also present the implementation of this model through smart contracts and the blockchain to set up a decentralized platform that ensures the security, traceability, and transparency of transactions."
