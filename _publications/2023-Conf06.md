excerpt: "Abstract : The democratization and massification use of credit cards lead inexorably to a high number of fraudulent transactions. Generally, the fraud detection is part of the anomaly detection problem. In this field, current approaches and techniques are constantly looking for optimized solutions to detect anomalies. Faced with a massive and growing data volume, these methods are put to the test, and thus lead to a large number of undetected anomalies. Real time fraud detection requires the design and implementation of scalable techniques capable of ingesting and analyzing massive amounts of data continuously. Recent advances in storage, data analytics processing, and open-source solutions open up new perspectives in the anomaly detection field and in particular fraud. In this article, we are interested in the design of a fraud detection system (FDS) based on open-sources Big Data technologies. Thus, a general methodology is proposed based on the formalization, the implementation and the technical design of a platform for fraud detection. The formalization part consists of four layers: distributed storage, data processing, model building, and finally the model evaluation. The implementation part uses Spark distributed data processing system. In particular, we are based on its framework dedicated to machine learning, called MLlib. The technical design part of the platform is based on the latest Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Yarn, Livy etc."

Abstract : The covid-19 crisis has severely affected the dynamics of the real estate sector, which is facing various financial and structural problems. The current real estate world is complicated by the lack of transparency in transactions such as rental, purchase, and sale, and it does not reach the level of confidentiality and authenticity of operational data. In addition, real estate financing brings together several players such as banks, notaries, and others, which makes the acquisition of real estate very expensive. With the advent of blockchain technology, many fields such as finance, accounting, and real estate have received a positive impact using the benefits of this technology. This article aims to reorganize real estate into a next-generation digitized system based on blockchain technology, by proposing a crowdfunding model that aims to eliminate intermediate, costs. Moreover, this model can allow to customers, who do not have immediate financing, the possibility of acquiring real estate. We also present the implementation of this model through smart contracts and the blockchain to set up a decentralized platform that ensures the security, traceability, and transparency of transactions.
