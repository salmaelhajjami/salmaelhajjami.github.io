excerpt: "Abstract : With the technological revolution of Internet and the information overload, adaptive E-learning has become the promising solution for educational institutions since it enhances students' learning process according to many factors such as their learning styles. Learning styles are a criteria of great import in E-learning environment because they can help the system to effectively personalize students' learning process. Generally, the traditional way of detecting students' learning style is based on asking students to fill out a questionnaire. However, using this static technique presents many problems. Some of these problems include the lack of self-awareness of students of their learning preferences. In addition, almost all students are bored when they are asked to fill out a questionnaire. Thus, in this work, we present an automatic approach for detecting students' learning style based on web usage mining. It consists in classifying students' log files according to a specific learning style model (Felder and Silverman model) using clustering algorithms (K-means algorithm). In order to test the efficiency of our work, we use a real-world dataset gathered from an E-learning system. Experimental results show that our approach provide promising results."

Abstract : With the expansion of machine learning and data mining in the context of Big Data analytics, the common problem that affects data is class imbalance. It refers to an imbalanced distribution of instances belonging to each class. This problem is present in many real world applications such as fraud detection, network intrusion detection, medical diagnostics, etc. In these cases, data instances labeled negatively are significantly more numerous than the instances labeled positively. When this difference is too large, the learning system may face difficulty when tackling this problem, since it is initially designed to work in relatively balanced class distribution scenarios. Another important problem, which usually accompanies these imbalanced data, is the overlapping instances between the two classes. It is commonly referred to as noise or overlapping data. In this article, we propose an approach called: One Side Behavioral Noise Reduction (OSBNR). This approach presents a way to deal with the problem of class imbalance in the presence of a high noise level. OSBNR is based on two steps. Firstly, a cluster analysis is applied to groups similar instances from the minority class into several behavior clusters. Secondly, we select and eliminate the instances of the majority class, considered as behavioral noise, which overlap with behavior clusters of the minority class. The results of experiments carried out on a representative public dataset confirm that the proposed approach is efficient for the treatment of class imbalances in the presence of noise.
