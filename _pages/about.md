I'm Salma EL HAJJAMI, an Assistant Professor and Researcher at the [Faculty of science](http://www.fsa.ac.ma/), [University of Ibno Zohr](https://www.uiz.ac.ma/), Morocco. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ENSA](https://ensaf.ac.ma/), [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University](http://www.usmba.ac.ma/) in Fez, Morocco, which I received in 2021. Additionally, I earned a degree in Computer Science Engineering from the National School of Applied Sciences in Fez, Morocco in 2015.

My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Imbalanced Big Data, Data Science, and Blockchain, and I work in a multidisciplinary environment to study these research fields to come up with solutions to various real-world problems. I focus on important parts of the life cycle of large data, especially analytical approaches for decision making, which must adapt to the context that implies the consideration of different approaches (decisional, learning, predictive, etc.). My research work covers different fields of applications such as health, environment, e-commerce, and others.

I have published several research papers at international journals and conferences and have served as a member of the technical committees of several international conferences and workshops. Currently, I am looking for new graduate students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. under my supervision. If you are interested, please include a brief bio, your CV, and recent transcripts.

Outside of academia, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the field of computer science and information retrieval. I am a member of the International Association of Engineers (IAENG) and the International Association of Online Engineering. Prior to my academic position, I worked as a Research and Development Engineer in the Ministry of Interior in Morocco from 2017 to 2021. I am eager to contribute my expertise and be part of exciting projects and challenges in the field of computer science and information retrieval.
