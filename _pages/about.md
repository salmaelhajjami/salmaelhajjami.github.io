I'm Salma EL HAJJAMI, an Assistant Professor and Researcher at the [Faculty of science](http://www.fsa.ac.ma/), [University of Ibno Zohr](https://www.uiz.ac.ma/), Morocco. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ENSA](https://ensaf.ac.ma/), [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University](http://www.usmba.ac.ma/) in Fez, Morocco, which I received in 2021. Additionally, I earned a degree in Computer Science Engineering from the National School of Applied Sciences in Fez, Morocco in 2015.

As a researcher, I am passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies and approaches that can help address a diverse range of real-world challenges. Specifically, my research interests are focused on Anomaly Detection, Imbalanced Big Data, IoT, Smart Applications, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Blockchain. I work in a multidisciplinary environment to investigate these fields comprehensively and identify innovative solutions to real-world problems. My research focus includes analytical approaches for decision making, which must be contextually adaptive and encompass different approaches (e.g., decisional, learning, predictive, etc.) to support the lifecycle of large data. Moreover, my research extends to several application fields, including Fintech, Health, Environment, and other domains, where I seek to contribute to scientific advancements and promote positive social impact.

I have published several research papers at international journals and conferences and have served as a member of the technical committees of several international conferences and workshops. Currently, I am looking for new graduate students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. under my supervision. If you are interested, please include a brief bio, your CV, and recent transcripts.

Outside of academia, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the field of computer science and information retrieval. I am a member of the International Association of Engineers (IAENG) and the International Association of Online Engineering. Prior to my academic position, I worked as a Research and Development Engineer in the Ministry of Interior in Morocco from 2017 to 2021. I am eager to contribute my expertise and be part of exciting projects and challenges in the field of computer science and information retrieval.
