Iâ€™m Salma EL HAJJAMI, I got my PhD degree in computer science in 2021 from [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University] (http://www.usmba.ac.ma/), Fez, Morocco. In 2015, I received, the engineer degree in computer science engineering from the National school of applied science (https://ensaf.ac.ma/), [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University] (http://www.usmba.ac.ma/), Fez, Morocco. Currently I am an Assistant Professor at the department of computer science in [Faculty of science](http://www.fsa.ac.ma/), [University of Ibno Zohr] (https://www.uiz.ac.ma/), Agadir, Morocco.

I work in a multidisciplinary environment involving machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data, Data Science and Blockchain. My research focus is to study those research fields to come up with solutions to various real-world problems. I'm interested in important parts of the life cycle of large data, especially analytical approaches for decision making. The latter must adapt to the context which implies the consideration of different approaches (decisional, learning, predictive, etc.). The field of application is an important component in my research work (health, environment, e-commerce, etc.).

I published several research papers at international journals and conferences. I served as a member of the technical committees of several international conferences and workshops.

I am currently looking for new graduate students. Students interested in pursing a Ph.D. under my supervision are welcome to contact me. Please include a brief bio, your CV, and recent transcripts.
