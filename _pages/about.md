Iâ€™m Youssouf EL ALLIOUI, I got my PhD in 2012 from [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University]( http://www.usmba.ac.ma/), Fez, Morocco. Currently I'm a professor at the department of computer science, [University of Sultan Moulay Slimane](http://www.usms.ac.ma/website/), Beni Mellal, Morocco. 

I work in a multidisciplinary environment involving machine learning, educational data mining (EDM), semantic web, knowledge management, Web Personalization and Recommender Systems, E-learning and semantic E-learning. My research focus is to study those research fields to come up with solutions to various real-world problems.

I published several research papers at international journals and conferences. I served as a member of the technical committees of several international conferences and workshops.

Since 2013, I have been a member of the reading committee & program of several conferences and journals : [Journal of Big Data](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/), Journal of e-Learning and Knowledge Society [Je-LKS](http://www.je-lks.org/ojs/index.php/Je-LKS_EN), International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision [ISCV'2020](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iscv2020), The 3rd International Conference on Information Technology & Electrical Engineering [ITee'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=itee19), The 4th International Conference On Big Data and Internet of Things [BDIoT'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdiot19), International Conference On Embedded Systems And Artificial Intelligence [ESAI'19](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=esai19), The international conference on WIreless Technologies, embedded and intelligent Systems [WITS-2019](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=wits2019) , International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision 2018 [ISCV2018](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iscv2018), The 4th IEEE Conference on Information and Multimedia Processing IEEE [IMP2018](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ieeeimp2018), The 3rd International Conference on Big Data, Cloud and Applications [BDCA'18](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdca18), The 2nd International Conference on Big Data, Cloud and Applications [BDCA'17](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bdca17).

Since 2007, I have taught computer science in several departments and several training courses (Initial, Master, engineer and professional) in several universities (public and private): Java EE Frameworks ([ESTA-OFPPT](https://www.ofppt.ma/)), project management ([Sup'management](https://www.supmanagement.ma/index.php)), advanced web development and Objective-C ([FST-Settat](http://www.fsts.ac.ma/)), C++, UML, Algorithm ([FP-Khouribga](http://www.fpk.ac.ma/)). For more information, please refer to my [CV page](https://yelallioui.github.io/cv/).

Since 2014, I have been the Education Coordinator of the Mathematics and computer sciences branch, and the responsible for many modules: object-oriented programming, Unified Modelling Language (UML), algorithms and data structures, operating systems, computer architecture, computer databases, ...

Beside teaching, I participated in many activities in the [Polydisciplinary faculty of Khouribga](http://www.fpk.ac.ma/), such as interviewing candidates and preparing recruiting competitions for new specialized technicians in IT development and IT networks.
